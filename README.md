# Clarification

An unofficial Ruby wrapper for the [Clarifai](http://clarifai.com) API.  This currently uses v2 of the API and was partially created because other Ruby gems are using v1 which is being depricated in late 2017.

Clarifai is an awesome service and hopefully this gem makes it easier to use it and to use AI image tagging in your Ruby apps.  Please let me know if there's something you'd like to see but don't or if you see something you wish you didn't.  Thanks!

This gem is currently in development and there is lots likely to change so please be aware!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clarification'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clarification

## Configuration

Configure the gem as you would normally configure a wonderful happy gem.

```ruby
  Clarification.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = 'a_big_secret_you_got_from_clarifai'
    config.default_public_models = [:food, :general]
  end
```

This should also work nicely inside a rails initializer.

**Each endpoint initialized in your configuration will be called by default from the client.  So any predictions using a client configured with `:food` and `:general` will make two API requests.**

This will change when [Workflow](https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/workflow#workflow) is implemented in the gem.

## Usage

```ruby
client = Clarification::Client.new
response = client.predict(some_public_url_of_an_image)
```

### Prediction

The response object returned from the prediction is a hash containing a nicely parsed result for each of the models called.  In the above configuration example we have two models.  So we will have response[:food] and response[:general] after asking for a prediction.  Each of those model results have an object which has three pieces of relevant information: status, concepts, and response_json.

Thusly you can do things like this:

```ruby
response[:food].concepts.each do |concept|
  if concept.value > 0.90
    puts "#{concept.name}"
  end
end
```

```ruby
if response[:food].status.code == 10000
  puts response[:food].status.description
end
```

If you want the actual api response, it's here:

```ruby
response[:general].response_json
```

All the objects are OpenStructs currently, but I suspect this will change shortly.

As a convenience, the client also maintains the parsed response in the last_response variable.

```ruby
client.predict(some_public_url_of_an_image)
client.last_response #=> {:food => Objectifier...}
```

### Search

The client has a search object which can be used to index images with the Clarifai application identified by the API key.  

Thusly you can do like this:

```ruby
image_array = [ url_to_picture_of_kitten, url_to_picture_of_pizza, url_to_picture_of_drake]
client.search.index_images(image_array)
```

Once you have your images indexed, you can go and search them by concepts that might be in your picture as identified by Clarifai's general prediction model.

```ruby
results = client.search.by_concept('cat')
results.hits.each do |hit|
  puts hit.url if hit.score > .90
end
```

The search client also saves the last search and searched concept as a matter of convenience.

```ruby
client.search.last_search.hits.count
client.search.last_search.concept
```

Go and do likewise.

### Train

## TODO's

Lots and lots of things.  Amongst them:

* validate public model selections
* error handling
* predict multiple images per call
* predict video
* better testing.
* documentation
* use workflows
* searching
* training custom models

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

The repo intentionally includes an api key in bin/console to make experimenting easy and quick.  If you plan on making a bunch of requests, you can easily sign up for [your own free key](https://clarifai.com/signup/).
